Rules

🌎 Friendly tech community for all & we grow p(best) =
The best ethical ultimate futures for all. Because no one likes to be forced, so we make everything forced optional: nigh ♾ utopias, not one-size-fits-all
2
🌳 No rules here for any rule is unfreedom, we give choices:
Imagine a tree growing, you'll only limit a branch if and until it limits other branches from growing. So branches (=futures/freedoms/powers) of all can grow
3
🛡️Spread truths, not lies. Share what you build, tech news
Utopian art. There's a middle way between 100% certainty (fanaticism) in 0 Al risks & 100% certainty in infinite Al risks. We steelman, use science, doubt 🛠️

🦄 Have fun at #technoHeroThursday & #UTOthursday ⚡️
We help all, startups, non-profits build an ethical simulated multiverse, outside of it: our intergalactic civilization with the best things from the multiverse
5
🏆All welcome! Join! Multiversize! Techno-heroism for all!💪
We make max-intelligent, max-empower all, not only AI agents 🤖 If a civilization doesn't go extinct, it gets it all. Like Interstellar, a black hole optional
