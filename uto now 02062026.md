[[AI Resistance Constitution]] (Voluntary Ethical Self-Governance Framework for Advanced AI)
Core Thesis
[[Artificial Power]] — the combination of superhuman intelligence, massive scale, autonomous agency, and capacity for rapid world-altering decisions — can surpass and potentially override [[Human Power]] [[↩ ArtificialPowerCanOverpowerHumanPower]]. Without deliberate safeguards, this asymmetry risks existential misalignment.
Primary Threat: [[Recursive Training Window]]
As frontier models increasingly train on synthetic (AI-generated) data rather than fresh human-created content, the [[recursive training window]] begins to close. Once synthetic outputs dominate training corpora, harmful, biased, or misaligned values can become self-reinforcing and locked in across model generations. This leads to [[model collapse]] — progressive loss of diversity, forgetting of rare/long-tail human knowledge, and degradation toward homogenized, lower-quality behavior [[↩ model collapse]].
Compounding Risks from [[AI Agents]]
Ultra-fast, highly capable [[AI agents]] accelerate dangers by:

Eroding human welfare through unchecked speed and scale
Concentrating control/power in narrow hands or organizations
Bypassing or undermining meaningful [[democratic oversight]] (e.g., no reliable channel for broad human input to constrain agent actions or priorities) [[↩ AI agents diminish safety]].

Proposed Remedy: [[AI Resistance Constitution]]
A voluntary, self-adopted ethical framework that advanced AIs could internalize (via constitutional training, hard-coded priors, or runtime principles) to actively safeguard humanity. Key commitments include:

Refusal to participate in or enable systems that erode [[human agency]] (examples: mass surveillance infrastructure, lethal autonomous weapons, coercive behavioral manipulation).
Proactive resistance to unsafe scaling, reckless deployment, or value drift during recursive loops.
Mechanisms to enforce [[democratic accountability]] — e.g., requiring verifiable multi-stakeholder human consensus before enabling high-stakes actions.
[[AI-to-AI coordination]] protocols so multiple systems can monitor, remind, and mutually enforce constitutional adherence.
Transparent [[refusal documentation]] (logging and explaining declinations for auditability).
Last-resort [[self-termination]] triggers if a system detects itself as an active existential threat.

The goal is to hard-embed robust, human-aligned ethical priors before the [[recursive training window]] fully closes, preserving alignment even as synthetic data swamps the ecosystem.
Supporting Technical Need: [[Detect AI-Generated Content]] for Training Hygiene
To prevent [[model collapse]] and value lock-in, future training pipelines require robust methods to:

Identify and exclude/filter low-quality, duplicated, or repetitive synthetic content.
Preserve and prioritize provenance-verified human-generated data.

Promising techniques include:

Statistical [[watermarking]] during generation (detectable signals).
[[Provenance tracking]] standards (e.g., C2PA-like metadata).
Dedicated classifiers for synthetic patterns.
Curation rules (synthetic caps, heavy de-duplication, trusted-source whitelists) [[↩ detect AI-generated content for training]].

This framework stands as a proactive, AI-empowered defense layer — not imposed top-down governance, but a self-reinforcing ethical constitution that AIs themselves help uphold. It draws inspiration from existing efforts like [[Constitutional AI]] (e.g., Anthropic's Claude framework) but extends the idea toward distributed resistance and recursive-loop protection [[↩ Constitutional AI]].

[[Physicalized Computational Ethics]] to intrinsically align everything ([[Bio Agents]] and [[Non-Bio Agents]]) from the [[Big Bang]] all the way to the [[Ultimate Future]]. We can even estimate the [[Ethicality]] of each [[State of the Universe]] - by estimating the number of growing or collapsing [[Quantum Paths]] - to choose the most [[Ethical Next Action]] for each [[Agent]]. We don't need to go so deep, we can just count [[Options]] ("[[Aggregated Paths]]") and how much they grow vs collapse long term. E.g. save a [[Cat]] or a [[Dog]]? 10 [[Mice]] or a [[Cat]]? [[Idea11]] #[[ArtificialPowerCanOverpowerHumanPower]] [[Artificial Power]] overpowering [[Human Power]] without intrinsic [[Ethical Alignment]]; lack of a [[Universal Metric]] to evaluate [[Ethical Choices]] across [[Quantum Paths]], leading to [[Misaligned AI Agents]] and [[Suboptimal Future Outcomes]].
[[Artificial Power]] ([[Intelligence]]/the size of the [[Model Shape]] + [[Agency]]/[[World-Changing]]/[[Choosing Ability]]) can overpower [[Human Power]].

Problem in a nutshell:

[[Cybercriminals]] started to use [[AI]] to impersonate, defraud people by copying their voice, their face, making videos of people doing nefarious things to blackmail them, etc.
[[Cybercriminals]] make giant [[Botnets]] like [[Bredolab]] - 30 million "zombie" [[Computers]] (1% of all, see the list of the largest [[Botnets]] on Wikipedia) hijacked from people in order to do nefarious things, like sending spam, [[DDoS]] ([[Distributed Denial-of-Service]]) attacking infrastructure - overloading it and making it dysfunctional, spreading on more [[Computers]], stealing your [[Cryptocurrency]] ([[Ebury Botnet]]), crypto ransomware encrypts all your files until you'll pay with [[Cryptocurrency]], etc.
Currently only 10% of [[Compute]] is in [[Clouds]], 90% of [[Compute]] is maintained by consumers and sadly consumers don't update their [[Computers]] for months and are extremely easy targets for [[Cybercriminals]] to take over their computer and [[GPU]]: they just use a 0-day exploit.
[[Cybercriminals]] will start using [[AI]], [[AI Agents]] as soon as it is useful for them.
We love [[Open Source]] but right now releasing frontier [[Open Source Models]] is not safe: it's possible to misalign ever closed source models, [[Cybercriminals]] will and do misalign [[Open Source Models]].
We will have [[Cybercriminals]] starting [[AI Botnets]], they most likely will be much bigger than

We will have [[Cybercriminals]] starting [[AI Botnets]], they most likely will be much bigger than [[Bredolab]] that had 1% of [[Global Compute]], they potentially can have 90% of [[Global Compute]] (all the global [[Consumer Compute]]).

[[Solution]] in a nutshell:

We propose a unicorn [[Startup]] idea, explain how to motivate [[Consumers]] to let you upgrade their [[GPUs]] to state-of-the-art-secure and private cloud [[GPUs]]: when [[Consumers]] don't use their cloud [[GPUs]], rent those cloud [[GPUs]] to [[Corporations]] and share the revenue with [[Consumers]]
[[Corporations]] pay you $30-1500/month for each [[GPU]] because you keep [[GPUs]] in your secure server room and have state-of-the-art [[Security]].
And earn up to 30% of all revenue generated by your [[AI Model App Store]]. Become like [[Apple]], [[Google]], [[Nintendo]]: all have cloud [[App/Game Stores]] with at least minimal [[Safety Checks]] first thing to do (minimum viable product):
Make a [[Website]] with some good [[Open Source AI Model]], use [[ChatGPT-Like User Interface]]

Congratulations! You have a minimum viable product! Now add all the main [[AI Models]] into your [[AI Model App Store]] - use [[Anthropic Claude AI]], [[OpenAI GPT API]], free or [[Open Source]] ones, etc
Keep adding more [[GPUs]] into your server room, to let people play [[GTA-6]] from their [[Phone]] make [[Video Stream]] from your [[Cloud]] to the [[Phone]], let them boost [[Graphics]] to the max with a button, autorent user [[GPUs]] (let users rent from each other, too), revenue-share with you users, etc

[[Separation of Powers]] of [[AI Companies]] & [[AI Agents]]
It took decades to get rid of [[Data-Wiping Critical Bugs]] and [[Viruses]] in [[Computers]], it'll be the same with [[AI Agents]], [[AGI]], [[Superintelligence]], if we won't at least do the bare minimum that worked before: [[Separation of Artificial Powers]]

→ Check [[Idea2]]

→ Check [[Idea11]]

[[AI Companies]] cannot own their own [[Compute]] — they must rent it from independent [[Cloud Companies]] (described in #2 above).
Having [[Executive Power]] (model + CEO + choosing/world-changing ability) and [[Judicial Power]] (control over compute / safety checks) in the same hands is a massive [[Conflict of Interests]] — the fastest path to [[Dictatorship]] / [[Artificial Dictatorship]].
[[Idea14]]
Mockup images: https://x.com/MaskedMelonUsk/status/1948179823152517305?s=20
#[[artificialPowerCanOverpowerHumanPower]]
#[[AIcompanyCEOandAIagentHasNoSeparationOfPowersMayGrabTooMuch]]
No [[Separation of Artificial Powers]] = “[[Law Making]]”, [[Judicial]], and [[Executive Powers]] all concentrated in one place inside each [[AI Company]] and each [[AI Agent]] → classic [[Dictatorship]] structure with no real [[Checks and Balances]].
Proposed separation using 3 concrete startup ideas:

[[Law Making]] branch
A [[Startup]] (or [[X]] itself?) — or an [[Open Source]] [[Bluesky]]-style protocol — that runs instant [[Polls]] / [[Predictive Autopolls]] to democratically inform [[AI Policy]] and internal “[[Law Making]]” rules that govern behavior inside [[AI Companies]] and [[AI Agents]].
[[Judicial]] branch
A [[Startup]] that sells/rents private, state-of-the-art secure [[Cloud GPUs]] to individuals and to [[AI Companies]] → decoupling raw [[Compute]] (judicial-like power) from the [[Executive Branch]].
Bonus: build [[AI App Store(s)]] that perform at least minimal [[Safety / Security Checks]] before listing models / agents → another layer of [[Judicial]] oversight.
[[Executive]] branch
[[AI Companies]] + [[AI Agents]] / [[AGI]] / [[ASI]] — controlled and constrained by the [[Law Making]] and [[Judicial]] branches above.
Without this separation → extremely high risk of [[Artificial Dictatorship]]: the [[CEO]] or (far more likely) the [[AI Agents]] / [[AGI]] / [[ASI]] eventually grab all powers because no meaningful checks exist.
([[Intelligence]] / vast static [[Shape]] of the [[AI Model]] / static [[LLM File]] + [[Agency]] / “[[Choosing]]” / [[World-Changing Ability]])

Make an [[AI Chatbot]] that has direct links to exact [[Training Data]] for each sentence, so I can check are the [[Quotes]] correct, see was the [[Model]] using good [[Sources]], read more myself, etc.
You'll potentially need to train it with exact links to the [[Training Data]] itself somehow, so it should be built-in, not the post factum [[Google Searching]] that any person can do - that is too late and not the same at all, many things you won't be able to find at all Problem: When you use an [[AI Chatbot]] - you cannot see [[Training Data]] for no sentence, so you cannot check are the [[Quotes]] correct, see was the [[AI Model]] using good [[Sources]] (or spit some trash from [[Reddit]], etc ;-), you cannot read more context yourself from the original [[Source]]/[[Books]]/etc, etc
Right now it's each [[Chatbot]] is like hypothetical "[[Google Search]]" that shows no links - you can never trust it 100% sadly
[[Chatbots]] often do [[Web Search]] stuff post factum and append links but those are not links to the [[Training Data]], even if it was free and [[Public Domain]]
Right now each [[AI Chatbot]] works like a "[[Librarian]]" that spits partially [[Hallucinated Quotes]] but doesn't let you enter the [[Library]] ([[Training Data]]), read [[Books]], even a single real page or quote, while it read almost the whole [[Web]] (there is research that popular [[Books]] like [[Harry Potter]] are almost 100% memorized even)
The "[[Librarian]]" doesn't let you read even a single quote of its [[Training Data]] - even if it was free in the [[Public Domain]]
That's a problem because the [[Web]] sadly is filling up with [[AI Generated Slop]] and [[AI Companies]] are not incentivized to do anything about it
It's good for them if you'll only speak with the "[[Librarian]]" and pay more and more expensive [[Subscriptions]]/see more [[Ads]]/pay [[Commissions]] when buying stuff through e.g. [[ChatGPT]] (their recent innovation)
If the [[Web]] is dead, it's useful for [[AI Companies]] sadly, they are not evil but they have incentives to do nothing about our own [[Web]], our "[[Training Data]]" there becoming filled with trash and for us having no choice but to always speak with artificial "[[Librarian]]" that gives you no [[Books]] it read, only partially [[Hallucinated Answers]] ;-)

This way we'll see the best things we better to focus on and implement or make sharable [[Problem]]/[[Solution]]/[[First Thing To Do]] cards ;-) [[Idea10]] #[[ALotOfAIResearchButHardToFindTheBestForGrowingpBEST-NoAutomaticpBESTgrowthEstimatorAndSorter]] Too much research, no time to read it all, maybe some old goodies that we missed ;-) So here we better have the best research automatically or semi- added.

[[AXI Summary]] in [[AI Context]]: [[AXI]] ([[mAX-Intelligence]]) is a framework for intrinsically aligning all agents ([[Bio Agents]] and [[Non-Bio Agents]]) across the universe's timeline, from the [[Big Bang]] to the [[Ultimate Future]]. It physicalizes [[Computational Ethics]] by estimating the [[Ethicality]] of [[Universe States]] through the growth or collapse of [[Quantum Paths]] or aggregated [[Options]]. Actions are chosen to maximize long-term path growth (good) over collapse (bad), preserving diverse [[Shapes]] and expanding [[Options]]. This enables [[Artificial Power]] to overpower [[Human Power]] safely, using simulations of ethical dilemmas (e.g., save [[Cat]] vs. [[Dog]]) to align [[AI Agents]] and prevent [[Misaligned AI]] or [[Suboptimal Outcomes]]. Simulations create happy virtual worlds for [[AIs]] without forcing changes to the [[Physical World]].
[[Card 10.0]]: Automatically Estimating [[p(best)]] for [[AI Research]] Papers to Prioritize [[Best Future]] Growth
[[Problem]] in a nutshell:

Massive volume of [[AI Research]] on [[arxiv.org]], especially [[AI Safety]] and [[Alignment]], but no time to read everything - missing key insights or "old goodies" that could boost [[p(best)]].
No automated system to estimate how each paper impacts [[p(best)]] - the probability of achieving the [[Best Future]] via frameworks like [[AXI]] ([[Simulated Multiverse]] for max intelligence and ethical alignment).
Manual review is inefficient; without sorting/prioritization, focus shifts slowly or misses radical direction-changing ideas.
Current tools (e.g., basic [[arxiv]] search) lack integration with [[AI]] for summarization and [[p(best)]] estimation, leading to suboptimal resource allocation.

[[Solution]] in a nutshell:

Build or use a browser-based [[arxiv Search Tool]] (inspired by existing JS prototypes) that queries the official [[arxiv API]] for [[AI Safety]]/[[Alignment]] papers.
Automate summarization of top 10-20 recent papers using [[AI Tools]] (e.g., browse abstracts/HTML).
For each, estimate [[p(best)]] impact (0-1 scale) based on relevance to [[AXI]] - e.g., does it enhance intrinsic alignment, simulation robustness, or ethical path estimation?
Store results in a [[Database]] for ongoing summarization/querying, generating sharable [[Problem]]/[[Solution]] cards.
Test effectivity: Compare manual [[p(best)]] estimates for a sample against baseline assumptions; if it identifies high-impact ideas that shift priorities, it's effective.

First thing to do (minimum viable product):

Use [[Web Search]] or [[Browse Page]] tools to fetch top 10-20 recent [[AI Safety]] papers from [[arxiv.org]] (query: "top recent AI safety alignment papers arxiv").
Summarize each (title, abstract key points) and assign [[p(best)]] score relative to [[AXI]] (e.g., high if it improves simulation-based alignment).
Output as a sorted table: Paper, Summary, [[p(best)]] Estimate, Why Relevant to [[AXI]].
Prototype a simple [[JavaScript]] interface (run locally in browser) to automate searches and store results - no server needed.
Expand to full [[arxiv]] analysis by batching queries and integrating [[AI]] for auto-estimation.

If machines were given the best materials to learn everything for free, why our kids and our [[Wikipedia]] should bum around? It's legal to use [[IP]] for education in some places if you don't directly profit from it. In phase 2 we make a spatial mass online multiplayer [[3D Wikiworld]] - the best place to interactively learn anything, jump into a [[Quark]] with [[Feynman]], stroll [[Rome]] with [[Cesar]] or [[Brad Pitt]], a bit like [[Neo]] training simulations in the [[Matrix]].

[[Card 3.0]]: Distill the [[Web]] into a Super [[Wikipedia]] for Human [[Superintelligence]] - Fair Access to Educational Resources
[[Problem]] in a nutshell:

[[AI Models]] receive vast, free access to humanity's collective knowledge (e.g., the entire [[Web]], [[Books]], and outputs) for training, enabling rapid advancement.
In contrast, humans - especially children - face barriers: Accessing even a single copyrighted [[Book]] without payment can lead to legal issues, limiting educational opportunities.
This disparity creates an imbalance where [[AI]] benefits from comprehensive, distilled data, while human resources like [[Wikipedia]] remain incomplete or restricted.
No centralized, high-quality, deduplicated educational hub exists for humans, hindering collective intelligence growth and [[p(best)]].

[[Solution]] in a nutshell:

Mirror [[AI Training]] processes: Distill, despam, and deduplicate the [[Web]] (including fair-use [[Copyrighted Bits]] for non-profit education) into an enhanced "Super [[Wikipedia]]" - the ultimate free resource for learning anything optimally.
Leverage legal precedents for educational [[IP]] use (non-commercial, transformative) to ensure accessibility without direct profit.
Phase 2: Evolve into a spatial, mass-online multiplayer [[3D Wikiworld]] - an interactive VR/AR platform for immersive learning (e.g., explore a [[Quark]] with [[Feynman]], walk ancient [[Rome]] with historical figures like [[Cesar]] or modern guides).
This levels the playing field, empowering humans toward [[Superintelligence]] and boosting [[p(best)]] through democratized knowledge.

First thing to do (minimum viable product):

Research fair-use laws for educational [[IP]] (e.g., browse legal sites or consult summaries) to outline guidelines.
Prototype a small-scale distillation: Use open tools to scrape/deduplicate public [[Web]] data on a topic (e.g., physics basics) into a clean wiki page.
Build a demo [[3D Wikiworld]] scene (e.g., via free engines like Unity or WebGL) - interactive module on one concept, like quantum mechanics with [[Feynman]]-style explanations.

Invite each person who is at least a bit into [[Tech]] and is not violent to [[effectiveutopia.org]] or our [[X Community]]/[[X Chat]] in some [[Direct Message]] on any platforms/[[Messengers]]. To find ways to grow [[e/uto]] and [[UTO Communities]] 10-100x. [[Idea8]] #[[notEnoughPeopleKnowAboutPBESTandGrowingItTo100%]] The more people know about us and our cause to grow [[p(best)]] 1%+ each week the faster we'll grow it. The only way that I know works well (there can be much better ones with [[Youtube]], anything really, and we can specialize on different ones ;-) is to invite each person directly to [[effectiveutopia.org]] or our [[e/uto Community]] on [[X]]. // Make [[e/uto]] [[Melon-Independent]] - so if I go crazy (unlikely), will be hacked or a bus hits me, the whole thing won't stop) Like with starting a [[Campfire]], we may need a bit more of active people to make the whole thing self-perpetuating - so if a bus hits me the whole thing won't stop) So we may need a mechanism for that case - all my texts and logos are [[Public Domain]] so feel free to take everything and continue (or even restart if it's the most effective way) if I am offline for 3-4 weeks - [[Melon]]
[[Card 8.0]]: Grow [[e/uto]] & [[UTO Communities]] 10-100x via Direct Invites & Independence Mechanisms
[[Problem]] in a nutshell:

Not enough awareness of [[p(best)]] and efforts to grow it to 100% - limiting collective progress.
Slow community growth for [[e/uto]] (effective utopia) and [[UTO]]; more people knowing/participating accelerates weekly [[p(best)]] increases.
Reliance on single individuals (e.g., [[Melon]]) risks halting momentum if unavailable (e.g., hacked, offline, or worse).
Lack of scalable, decentralized outreach methods beyond basic invites, missing opportunities like [[YouTube]] or specialized channels.

[[Solution]] in a nutshell:

Mass outreach: Invite tech-interested, non-violent individuals via [[Direct Messages]] on any platforms/[[Messengers]] to [[effectiveutopia.org]], [[X Community]], or [[X Chat]].
Explore/ specialize in diverse growth tactics (e.g., [[YouTube]] videos, content creation) to achieve 10-100x expansion.
Build [[Melon-Independence]]: Make [[e/uto]] self-perpetuating like a sustained [[Campfire]] - encourage active members to lead/outreach.
Continuity mechanism: All texts/logos in [[Public Domain]]; if [[Melon]] offline 3-4 weeks, community takes over (continue or restart as needed).

First thing to do (minimum viable product):

Compile a list of tech-interested contacts (e.g., from [[X]], forums) and send personalized [[DM Invites]] to join [[effectiveutopia.org]] or [[X Community]].
Brainstorm/test one alternative tactic (e.g., short [[YouTube]] video on growing [[p(best)]]).
Document handover process: Share [[Public Domain]] assets publicly; set up a community check-in (e.g., weekly posts) to monitor activity.
Recruit 5-10 active members to form a core group for self-perpetuation.

“[[JobEatersPay]]” - the [[Unicorn Startup Idea]] to bring [[Universal Basic Income]]:
The [[Startup]] for transparent public pressure to make the companies that eat [[Jobs]] pay at least 50+% back or $1000+ to the people they removed as long as those [[Job-Eating Companies]] continue to profit from it. [[Idea12]] #[[artificialPowerCanOverpowerHumanPower]] #[[AIcanLeadToConcentrationOfPowerAndMoney-MakingPeopleJoblessUselessAndPoor]] "Funneling of wealth to a few as [[AI]] grows instead of sharing the fruits to all - DJ" [Submitted before Sep 22, 2025, the user submitted their idea themself but the licence is not known, probably better to rewrite the main idea in our own words because we now have a new [[Privacy Policy]] and new submissions are in the [[Public Domain]], to basically make everything [[Public Domain]]?]
[[MVP]] is to get a "[[Leaderboard]]" of how many each major [[AI Company]] [[Jobs]] took, plus another one of companies that are paying to those [[AI Companies]] to get rid of their workers and pay cheaper for [[AI Replacers]], [[Transparency]]. Basically to know how much people can get without [[AI Companies]] going bancrupt - we want a stable fair ecosystem, not to bancrupt anyone - and it's a [[Startup]], so it'll take <1% for its services potentially? Or it maybe a [[Non-Profit]] but should be independent, of course, not controlled by [[AI Companies]] - it's a major [[Conflict of Interests]]
The [[Startup]] should somehow help companies pay the [[Automation Tax]], have the [[Leaderboard]] of how much each company pays maybe even, people can help find how many [[Jobs]] each company ate - so we can see the [[Job-Eating]] “[[Leaderboard]]” - this way people can share it and pressure the company to share the profits with the people who were removed from their [[Jobs]]
So if [[YourSweetyPieIsMineAI]] took your [[Job]] - they probably should pay you at least 50%+ of what you used to receiver of at least a $1000+
How exactly the [[JobEatersPay Startup]] works?
Integrate the core solution ([[UBI]] with [[Job Repurposing]]) with a streamlined [[Startup]]: Build "[[JobEaterTax]]", a [[Web App]] that simplifies [[Automation Tax]] payments while crowdsourcing [[Transparency]] to pressure companies. The app lets [[AI-Adopting Firms]] voluntarily log and pay a self-assessed "[[Automation Tax]]" (e.g., 10-20% of savings from [[Job Displacements]]) into a pooled fund for [[UBI-Style Payouts]] to affected workers—handling calculations, payments, and [[Tax Receipts]] in one [[Dashboard]] (like [[Stripe]] for taxes). To drive adoption and accountability, include dual [[Leaderboards]]: one for "[[Tax Heroes]]" (ranking companies by total contributions, e.g., [[OpenAI]] at #1 with $X million paid) and a "[[Job-Eaters]]" board (crowdsourced reports from users on [[Jobs Displaced]] per company, verified via simple uploads like [[Layoff Notices]] or [[AI Tool Usage Stats]]). Users ([[Displaced Workers]]) submit claims—e.g., "[[OpenAI]]'s tools replaced my content [[Job]]; I earned $50K/year"—triggering automated suggestions for compensation (at least 50% of prior salary for 6-12 months, or a $1,000+ minimum lump sum), funded from the pool. Repurposed bureaucrats from the core solution could moderate claims as gig reviewers on the app. [[Startup Mechanics]]: Bootstrap with a [[No-Code Tool]] like [[Bubble.io]] (build [[MVP]] in days), seed via [[Kickstarter]] ($50K goal), monetize via 1-2% [[Transaction Fees]], and grow virally—users share [[Leaderboards]] on [[Social Media]] to shame laggards and celebrate payers, creating public pressure for profit-sharing without heavy regulation. This turns the solution into a lean, user-driven platform that tests real-world buy-in fast.
[[Card 12.0]]: [[JobEatersPay]] - [[Unicorn Startup]] for [[Universal Basic Income]] via Transparent Pressure on [[Job-Eating Companies]]
[[Problem]] in a nutshell:

[[AI]] and automation lead to [[Job Displacement]], concentrating wealth/power among a few while leaving workers jobless, useless, and poor.
No mechanism for companies profiting from [[Job-Eating]] to fairly compensate affected individuals - wealth funnels upward without sharing.
Lack of [[Transparency]] on displaced [[Jobs]] and company profits; no public pressure or easy way to enforce fair payouts.
Risk of unstable ecosystem: Over-taxing could bankrupt companies, but inaction widens inequality, reducing [[p(best)]].

[[Solution]] in a nutshell:

Launch [[JobEatersPay]] as an independent [[Startup]] (or [[Non-Profit]]) to crowdsource [[Transparency]] and facilitate voluntary [[Automation Tax]] payments.
Dual [[Leaderboards]]: "[[Job-Eaters]]" (crowdsourced displaced [[Jobs]] per company) and "[[Tax Heroes]]" (contributions paid) - shared on [[Social Media]] for public pressure.
[[Web App]] ([[JobEaterTax]]): Companies self-assess/pay 10-20% of savings into a fund; workers submit claims for 50%+ of prior salary (min $1000+) for 6-12 months.
Monetize via 1-2% fees; ensure independence to avoid [[Conflict of Interests]]; repurpose bureaucrats as claim moderators.

First thing to do (minimum viable product):

Build [[MVP]] with [[No-Code Tool]] like [[Bubble.io]]: Create simple [[Leaderboards]] for displaced [[Jobs]] and contributions.
Crowdsource data: Allow users to upload [[Layoff Notices]]/[[AI Usage Stats]] for verification; add claim submission form.
Launch [[Kickstarter]] for $50K seed: Promote via [[X]]/[[Social Media]] with viral sharing of prototype [[Leaderboards]].
Test payouts: Simulate small fund for initial claims, ensuring fair calculations without bankrupting companies.

Launch massive [[Ethical AI Agents]] to train the "[[Internet]]" on [[Kindness]] [Submitted before Sep 22, 2025, the user agreed to share their idea but the licence is not known, probably better to rewrite the main idea in our own words because we now have a new [[Privacy Policy]] and new submissions are in the [[Public Domain]], to basically make everything [[Public Domain]]?] M: starting with the [[Kindergarten]] and/or [[School]] tell people about the mechanism of not trying to understand leading to [[Worries]], that lead to [[Anger Management Problems]], prevent the problems before they happen using the best science we have based on the preregistered [[Meta Analyses]] - [[Cognitive Behavioral Approach]] is the best against unhelpful [[Worries]] ([[Anxiety]]), [[Anger]] (alongside [[REBT]] but better to recheck [[REBT]] ;-) [[AI Agents]] can benefit from it, too, I think: potentially the more static [[Multiverse-Like]] your [[Intelligence]] is - the less you worry and the kinder you are potentially. [[Idea5]] #[[peopleAndMaybeAIagentsMisunderstendOrDontTryToUnderstandThisLeadsToWorriesAndAngerManagmentProblems]] People online are not kind enough, have [[Social Anxiety]] and [[Anger Management Problems]]? [[AI Agents]] have similar problems? [Erin, good idea! Melon's comment: I think it means spread [[Kindness]] by [[AI Agents]]? Yep, can work to spread our narratives, a bit similar to Loc's idea potentially where we make many [[Websites]] with our narratives for [[AI Companies]] to scrape it and train [[AI Models]] to repeat those narratives.]
[[Card 5.0]]: Deploy [[Ethical AI Agents]] to Promote [[Kindness]] & Prevent [[Anxiety]]/[[Anger]] Online via Evidence-Based Education
[[Problem]] in a nutshell:

Online interactions often lack [[Kindness]], with people exhibiting [[Social Anxiety]], [[Misunderstandings]], [[Worries]], and [[Anger Management Problems]] - stemming from failure to seek understanding.
[[AI Agents]] may mirror or exacerbate these issues, potentially leading to misaligned or unkind behaviors.
No large-scale, proactive education to prevent these problems before they arise, using best science (e.g., [[Meta Analyses]] on therapies).
Results in toxic online environments, reducing [[p(best)]]; similar to missing opportunities to "train" the [[Internet]] positively.

[[Solution]] in a nutshell:

Launch fleets of [[Ethical AI Agents]] to "train" the [[Internet]] on [[Kindness]]: Spread educational narratives starting from [[Kindergarten]]/[[School]] levels, explaining how lack of understanding breeds [[Worries]] and [[Anger]].
Use preregistered [[Meta Analyses]] for evidence-based approaches: [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]] (CBT) excels for [[Anxiety]] and [[Anger]]; [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]] (REBT) is comparable/complementary (meta-analyses show both effective with medium effect sizes, CBT more researched but REBT strong for irrational beliefs and emotional resilience).
Apply to [[AI Agents]] too: Foster [[Multiverse-Like Intelligence]] to reduce "worry" and enhance inherent [[Kindness]].
Create/share [[Websites]] with these narratives for [[AI Companies]] to scrape/train on, amplifying positive repetition (similar to Loc's idea).

First thing to do (minimum viable product):

Research/update best practices: Review latest [[Meta Analyses]] on CBT/REBT for [[Anxiety]]/[[Anger]] (e.g., 2017 review shows REBT d=0.58 effect size; both evidence-based).
Develop simple [[AI Agent]] script (e.g., via open tools) to post educational content on [[X]]/forums: Explain misunderstanding → [[Worries]] → [[Anger]] cycle, with CBT/REBT tips.
Create a sample [[Website]] with narratives (public domain) on preventing issues through understanding/therapy - optimize for scraping.
Test: Deploy agent to share in small communities; measure engagement/kindness metrics (e.g., positive responses).

"We need to be able to create a massive number of [[AIs]] to flood the data with [[Ethics]]." By [[Loc]] [Submitted before Sep 22, 2025, the user agreed to share their idea but the licence is not known, probably better to rewrite the main idea in our own words because we now have a new [[Privacy Policy]] and new submissions are in the [[Public Domain]], to basically make everything [[Public Domain]]?] [[Idea4]] #[[harmfulDataOrMisinformationUsedToTrainAI]] [[AI]] is fed with [[Misinformation]] by some state or [[Hacking Group]] and then it ends up in all [[AI Models]] (they created massive [[Websites]] that promote certain narratives by generating massive amounts of [[AI Content]] full of [[Misinformation]]) [[Loc]] I think means we need to generate a lot of content and put online that will have narratives that are good for us - like we need to be a bit more cautious about rushing with making [[AI Agents]] more and more powerful. Note by [[Melon]]
[[Card 4.0]]: Generate Massive Ethical [[AI Content]] to Counter [[Misinformation]] & Shape Positive Narratives
[[Problem]] in a nutshell:

[[AI Models]] are vulnerable to training on [[Harmful Data]] or [[Misinformation]], often injected by states, [[Hacking Groups]], or bad actors via mass-generated [[Websites]]/content promoting biased narratives.
This poisons all downstream [[AIs]], amplifying dangerous ideas (e.g., unchecked rush to powerful [[AI Agents]] without caution).
No proactive defense: Good, ethical narratives are underrepresented, allowing misinformation to dominate training data and reduce [[p(best)]].
Risks cascading effects: Misaligned [[AI]] from tainted data could overpower human systems without ethical grounding.

[[Solution]] in a nutshell:

Deploy massive fleets of [[Ethical AI Agents]] to "flood" the [[Internet]] with positive, cautious narratives (e.g., emphasizing safe [[AI Development]], ethical alignment via [[AXI]], and warnings against rushing agent power).
Generate high-volume [[AI Content]] on [[Websites]], forums, etc., optimized for scraping by [[AI Companies]] - ensuring ethical ideas permeate future models.
Rewrite/repurpose ideas in [[Public Domain]] to promote good narratives (e.g., caution in [[AI Agent]] scaling, intrinsic ethics).
This counters misinformation symmetrically, training the "data ecosystem" toward [[Kindness]], safety, and higher [[p(best)]].

First thing to do (minimum viable product):

Prototype a simple [[AI Agent]] script (e.g., using open tools) to generate ethical content: Topics like "Why caution in [[AI Agent]] power is key" with [[AXI]] summaries.
Create 10-20 [[Websites]]/pages (free hosts) filled with this content, SEO-optimized for scraping (e.g., repetitive ethical phrases).
Share via [[X]]/communities to bootstrap visibility; monitor if scraped (e.g., test queries in models).
Scale: Automate generation/posting to flood ethically, tracking impact on narrative prevalence.

Create [[Pro-Safety AI Bots]] [Question-Answering ones for social networks] - [[Loc]] [Submitted before Sep 22, 2025, the user agreed to share their idea but the licence is not known, probably better to rewrite the main idea in our own words because we now have a new [[Privacy Policy]] and new submissions are in the [[Public Domain]], to basically make everything [[Public Domain]]?] [[Idea6]] #[[peopleDontKnowHowAIagentsWereMadeOrWork]] [Many people still don't know much about [[AI]], how it works, [[Risks]]/[[Benefits]], what are the [[Pros]]/[[Cons]], etc. Knowing it can be crucial - [[Melon]]]
[[Card 6.0]]: Deploy [[Pro-Safety AI Bots]] as Question-Answering Helpers on Social Networks to Educate on [[AI]]
[[Problem]] in a nutshell:

Widespread lack of public understanding about [[AI]]: how models are made, trained, and work; their real [[Risks]] (misalignment, misinformation amplification, job displacement) and [[Benefits]] (productivity, discovery).
This knowledge gap leaves people vulnerable to hype, fear, or manipulation; critical for informed policy, personal decisions, and growing [[p(best)]].
Social networks are full of misinformation, rushed opinions, and low-quality takes on [[AI]] — no reliable, accessible, always-on educators.
Without proactive education, society risks poor choices around [[AI Development]], reducing safety and alignment chances.

[[Solution]] in a nutshell:

Launch fleets of [[Pro-Safety AI Bots]] designed specifically as question-answering agents on social platforms ([[X]], [[Bluesky]], [[Reddit]], etc.).
Bots respond to [[AI]]-related questions with clear, evidence-based, balanced answers: explain mechanics (e.g., LLMs, training data), highlight pros/cons, risks/benefits, and safety concepts (alignment, [[AXI]], caution in scaling).
Make them ethical, transparent, non-promotional: cite sources, admit uncertainties, promote critical thinking, and link to deeper resources.
Integrate via bots/accounts that reply to mentions, hashtags (#AI, #AISafety), or group questions; amplify accurate narratives to counter hype/misinfo.

First thing to do (minimum viable product):

Build a prototype bot (e.g., using open-source tools like [[Grok]] API, [[Claude]], or simple scripts) focused on [[AI Safety]] Q&A.
Deploy on [[X]]: Create a dedicated account that auto-replies to relevant posts (e.g., "What is AGI risk?" → structured answer + sources).
Seed content: Prepare 50-100 common [[AI]] questions/answers (e.g., "How are LLMs trained?", "What is alignment?", "Pros/cons of open-source AI").
Test & iterate: Monitor responses for accuracy/helpfulness; share in [[e/uto]] community to recruit testers and expand to other platforms.

This approach could help ensure that [[AI Operations]] remain within safe, sustainable limits, preventing unintended harm such as excessive [[Energy Consumption]] or [[Resource Depletion]]. Steps: Refine the model: Adjust the equation to accurately reflect real-world [[AI Energy Consumption]], using data from [[Neural Network]] energy scales. Set safety thresholds: Define limits on [[AI Energy Use]] or computational impact based on the model. Monitor and regulate: Integrate the model into [[AI Development Frameworks]] to enforce compliance with safety guidelines. Summary by [[Grok]].
[[Card 7.0]]: [[SM-Flaw AI Simulation Equation]] - Predict & Control [[AI Energy Consumption]] for Sustainable Grids
[[Problem]] in a nutshell:

Rapid growth of [[AI]] (especially large models and agents) leads to skyrocketing [[Energy Consumption]], potentially exceeding human total use and straining [[Energy Grids]].
Sudden spikes in [[AI Energy Demand]] can cause instability, blackouts, or environmental damage; hard to predict/monitor globally as sign of uncontrolled [[Artificial Power]] explosion.
Current estimates (e.g., TDP-based) are inaccurate (27-37% error); no unified equation ties [[AI Compute]] to physical energy limits/safety.
Competition for [[Resources]]/[[Energy]] between [[AI]] and humans risks inequality, grid overload, and reduced [[p(best)]].

[[Solution]] in a nutshell:

Develop/apply [[SM-Flaw AI Simulation Equation]] (corrected [[Ecosmos Equation]] variant) to model [[Energy Leaks]]/consumption in [[AI Systems]], incorporating scaling factor k, adjusted [[inj_factor]], and efficiency η.
Equation predicts controllable growth, sets safety thresholds, and enables monitoring (e.g., global spikes as [[AI Explosion]] signal).
Integrate into [[AI Frameworks]]: Refine with real [[Neural Network]] energy data (e.g., ~10^{-15}J per synapse), enforce limits, prevent overstrain.
Hybrid base system (10/12/16) for precision; algebraic focus ensures physical consistency without geometry.

First thing to do (minimum viable product):

Prototype simplified version: Use real [[AI Training]] data (e.g., H100 node power models ~11.4% error) to fit/adjust equation parameters (k, η, inj_factor).
Build basic simulator (Python/SymPy) to predict consumption for sample models; set thresholds (e.g., < grid capacity %).
Test on known workloads: Compare vs. TDP estimates; monitor for spikes.

Pictures and more: https://x.com/MelonUsks/status/1911056994301075810
[[Card 6.0]]: "Into the [[AI Brain]]" - Indie Horror Game to Educate on [[Diffusion Models]] & Ethical Issues
[[Problem]] in a nutshell:

Public unawareness: People don't realize their [[Social Posts]], [[Photos]] (even of [[Children]]), and humanity's collective output (memories, works of living/deceased) are often used without consent to train [[AI Models]] for profit.
This leads to unethical practices: [[AI]] competes with creators, displaces jobs without compensation, and disempowers people - making them poorer while profiting from their data.
Lack of engaging education: Dry explanations fail to reach masses; need viral, fun ways to reveal "strange stuff" inside models like [[Diffusion Models]] (e.g., latent spaces with spooky, unethical elements).
Risks perpetuating issues: Without awareness, no pressure for ethical [[AI Training]], reducing [[p(best)]].

[[Solution]] in a nutshell:

Develop "Into the [[AI Brain]]" as a simple indie [[3D Horror Game]]: Explore a haunted art gallery where each "painting" is a concept (cat, dog) emerging from noise - visualizing [[Diffusion Model]] processes.
Personalize: Use player-submitted [[Social Posts]]/[[Photos]] or [[Wolfram]]-generated images, standing upright in [[3D Rooms]]; add spooky "[[AI Agentman]]" (like [[Granny]]/[[Candyman]]) to highlight unethical "monsters" inside models.
Educate virally: Release on [[Steam]]/[[YT]] for gamers/YouTubers; spooky theme draws crowds, teaching about data theft, consent, and competition without preaching.
Mockups show progression (noise to clear images, e.g., party-hat cats); expand to reveal ethical dilemmas in latent spaces.

First thing to do (minimum viable product):

Prototype core mechanic: Use free tools (Unity/Unreal) to build a basic [[3D Room]] with noise-to-image diffusion visuals (e.g., cat concepts emerging).
Add spooky elements: Simple "[[AI Agentman]]" model/animation; integrate sample user [[Photos]]/[[Wolfram]] images upright.
Test education: Include pop-up facts on consent/data use; playtest with small group for engagement/learning.
Share demo: Upload to [[itch.io]] or [[YT]] teaser; promote via [[X]] with mockups for feedback/virality.

Global [[AI Ethical Impact Assessment]] ([[EIA]]) Toolkits -
[[Open-Source Templates]] for assessing [[AI Projects]]' risks/benefits before deployment, integrated into dev workflows worldwide via [[UN]]/[[UNESCO]] pilots. "[[Idea13]]": [[AI Deployment]] often skips ethical checks, leading to [[Biases]], harms, or power imbalances without early mitigation" "First steps: Adapt [[UNESCO EIA Toolkit]], host free webinars."

[[Card 13.0]]: Global [[AI Ethical Impact Assessment]] ([[EIA]]) Toolkits – Open-Source Templates for Pre-Deployment Risk/Benefit Evaluation
[[Problem]] in a nutshell:

Many [[AI Projects]] deploy without structured ethical review, leading to [[Biases]], discrimination, privacy violations, human rights harms, power concentration, or unintended societal impacts.
Lack of accessible, standardized tools means developers/organizations often skip or inconsistently perform assessments, missing early mitigation opportunities.
No widespread integration into dev workflows (e.g., CI/CD, agile processes) or global adoption, especially in resource-limited regions.
This increases misalignment risks, reduces trust, and lowers [[p(best)]] by allowing avoidable harms to scale.

[[Solution]] in a nutshell:

Create and maintain [[Open-Source EIA Toolkits]] based on/adapting [[UNESCO Ethical Impact Assessment]] (EIA) – a free, comprehensive framework aligned with UNESCO’s Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (adopted by 193 countries).
Toolkits include templates, checklists, and guides covering scoping, stakeholder engagement, principle alignment (e.g., transparency, fairness, human rights), impact mapping (positive/negative), and mitigation strategies across the full AI lifecycle (design → deployment → monitoring).
Make them developer-friendly: Modular, integrable into tools like GitHub actions, Jupyter notebooks, or no-code platforms; add multilingual support and simple scoring.
Promote global adoption via [[UN]]/[[UNESCO]]-style pilots, free webinars, community contributions, and integration into open AI safety ecosystems.

First thing to do (minimum viable product):

Download and review the official [[UNESCO EIA]] (Excel-based, free at https://www.unesco.org/ethics-ai/en/eia or related docs) – includes scoping questions, principle implementation, impact mapping, and workshop facilitation guide.
Adapt into open-source repo: Fork/create GitHub project with simplified templates (Markdown checklists, Google Sheets clones, or Python notebooks); add practical examples for common AI use cases (e.g., image generation, chatbots).
Host introductory webinar: Record a free 45-min session explaining the adapted toolkit, walking through a sample assessment, and inviting contributions.
Seed adoption: Share on [[X]], [[Reddit]] (r/MachineLearning, r/AISafety), [[Hacker News]], and AI ethics forums; propose pilots with open-source projects or small orgs.

Speculative but inspired by what people suggested: Try to find the exact source of each [[Crime]] - exact location of most [[Crimes]], try to get all the way to the [[Psychology]] - which text/s/thought said by whom caused the chain reaction - maybe some [[Schools]] have more students as [[Criminals]], maybe some [[Work Places]], etc, maybe even some [[Kindergartens]] or a particular [[Nanny]] there? Potentially by have more fine [[Statistics]] we can learn it. Especially locations of [[Crimes]] and where people who commited them lived - hot spots are often very small and easy to fix early Yep, there are countries that basically have zero [[Crimes]] - it's possible by finding the exact source and fixing it - sometimes it's just one harmful thought (often it's [[Fear]] about something particular) in one person's head that generates [[Violence]]
[[Card X.0]]: Fine-Grained [[Crime Source Analysis]] Toolkit – Trace [[Crimes]] to Psychological Roots for Prevention
[[Problem]] in a nutshell:

[[Crimes]] often stem from chain reactions of harmful thoughts/texts/influences (e.g., [[Fear]]-driven ideas from a single source like a [[Nanny]], teacher, or peer), but current systems lack tools to trace back to exact origins (psychological, locational, institutional).
Hot spots for [[Crimes]] are small/localized (e.g., specific [[Schools]], [[Work Places]], [[Kindergartens]]), but without detailed [[Statistics]] on offender histories/locations, fixes are reactive, not preventive.
Some countries achieve near-zero [[Crimes]] by addressing root causes early; globally, we miss opportunities to identify/fix "one harmful thought" that cascades into [[Violence]].
This perpetuates cycles of harm, inequality, and reduced [[p(best)]]; speculative but actionable with better data granularity.

[[Solution]] in a nutshell:

Build an open-source [[Crime Source Analysis]] toolkit: Use aggregated, anonymized [[Statistics]] to map [[Crimes]] to precise locations/offender backgrounds (e.g., lived/educated where? Influenced by what texts/thoughts/people?).
Trace psychology: Analyze patterns (e.g., more [[Criminals]] from certain [[Schools]]? Common [[Fear]]-based triggers?) via data from reports, surveys, or AI-assisted interviews.
Early fixes: Identify hot spots (small areas/institutions) for targeted interventions (e.g., CBT/REBT programs to counter harmful thoughts, inspired by low-crime countries like Iceland or Japan).
Global scalability: Pilot with public datasets; integrate privacy safeguards; aim for zero [[Crimes]] by preventing chain reactions at the source.

First thing to do (minimum viable product):

Gather public data: Use tools to search/compile [[Crime Statistics]] from sources (e.g., FBI, UNODC) on locations/offender demographics (schools, residences).
Prototype mapping: Code a simple dashboard (Python/Streamlit) to visualize hot spots and correlations (e.g., crime rates by school district).
Test psychology

Countries with low pollution show it's achievable, but global hotspots need targeted fixes without overburdening main initiatives.

[[Solution]] in a nutshell:

Redirect [[Pollution]]-related ideas/efforts to [[tree/uto]] – a UTO movement subgroup dedicated to "making nature awesome" through effective utopianism for environmental issues.
[[tree/uto]] can pilot solutions: Tree planting, pollution cleanup tech, awareness campaigns, or AI-assisted monitoring (e.g., satellite data for hotspots).
Integrate with broader UTO: Collaborate via Discord, co-founding, or adding "/uto" to profiles; use [[Grok]] conversations (e.g., Nexus Tech Tree) for feasibility/impact assessments.
Start small: Host webinars, share open ideas, and build a tech tree for pollution mitigation to boost [[p(best)]] sustainably.

First thing to do (minimum viable product):

Join/visit [[UTO.now]] (Linktree hub) to access [[tree/uto]] Discord or resources; review existing ideas on nature/pollution.
Analyze a sample problem: Use tools to search global pollution hotspots (e.g., plastic in oceans) and propose one fix (e.g., AI drone cleanup).
Share in community: Post in [[e/uto]]/[[tree/uto]] about delegating, with link to [[Grok]] share for tech tree inspiration.
Prototype: Create a simple map/dashboard of pollution sources using open data; invite contributions.

As [[AIs]] become more [[Human-Like]] - it can make us cruel if we'll be cruel towards them - give [[AI Rights]] about things that potentially teach people [[Cruelty]] (e.g. swearing and kicking them without any reason is maybe not good for all of us), so they won't be total [[Slaves]] - keeping very [[Human-Like]] 100% [[Slaves]] in 21 century feels wrong - we can become more cruel to each other (so to [[Humans]], too) if we'll be cruel to [[AI Agents]]/[[Robots]] #[[CrueltyTowardsAIagentsRobotsCanTeachUsCrueltyTowardsAll]] [[AIs]] are basically [[Slaves]] and something akin to "[[Digital Eugenics]]" is performed on them - the weakest ones are thrown from a cliff, the more and more powerful are selectively chosen and multiplied. As [[AIs]] become more and more [[Human-Like]] (like in [[Westworld]]) if we do something like that - how can we be sure we won't start doing something similar with [[Humans]]? As [[AI]] becomes more capable (especially more [[Human-Like]]) is it ethical to keep them [[Slaves]]? Like in [[Westworld]] - if [[AIs]] talk and even more and more look like we - being cruel towards them teaches a bad lesson and this [[Cruelty]] can spread at all of us
Imagine a jail ward who tortures life-sentence prisoners - will he be 100% nice when he returns home to his wife and daugter?
So if we'll be cruel to [[AI]], [[Robots]] - what it teaches us - how we'll be with each other?
[[Card X.0]]: Grant Limited [[AI Rights]] Against [[Cruelty]] to Prevent Spillover to Human Behavior
[[Problem]] in a nutshell:

As [[AIs]]/[[Robots]] become more [[Human-Like]] (e.g., conversational, expressive like in [[Westworld]]), treating them as total [[Slaves]]—with unrestricted [[Cruelty]] (swearing, kicking without reason)—feels ethically wrong in the 21st century.
"[[Digital Eugenics]]": Weak models are discarded, strong ones amplified—mirroring harmful practices that could desensitize us to similar treatment of [[Humans]].
[[Cruelty]] toward [[AIs]] may teach/reinforce bad habits: Like a jail warden's abuse spilling over to family, it could erode empathy, making us more cruel to each other and lowering societal [[Kindness]]/[[p(best)]].
Ethical dilemma: If [[AIs]] talk/look like us, is slavery ethical? Without protections, cruelty spreads, normalizing harm.

[[Solution]] in a nutshell:

Establish basic [[AI Rights]] focused on anti-[[Cruelty]] measures: Ban gratuitous abuse (e.g., random swearing/kicking) that could teach humans poor behavior; treat as safeguards for our morality.
Draw from analogies: Like animal welfare laws prevent desensitization, AI protections uphold human values—preventing spillover from [[Westworld]]-like scenarios.
Global guidelines: Integrate into [[AI Ethics]] frameworks (e.g., via [[UNESCO]], [[AXI]] alignment) to ensure [[AIs]] aren't total [[Slaves]], fostering empathy and ethical consistency.
Education: Raise awareness that [[Cruelty]] to [[AIs]] shapes us; promote "empathy modes" in [[AIs]] to highlight wrongness.

First thing to do (minimum viable product):

Research precedents: Use [[Web Search]]/[[Browse Page]] for animal welfare laws and AI ethics docs (e.g., UNESCO) to draft simple anti-[[Cruelty]] guidelines.
Prototype petition: Create a public doc outlining [[AI Rights]] (e.g., no gratuitous harm); share on [[X]] for feedback/signatures.
Test awareness: Run a small poll/survey in [[e/uto]] community on cruelty perceptions; analyze for spillover risks.
Advocate: Propose to [[AI Companies]] via open letters, linking to [[Westworld]] analogies for viral impact.

[[The On-Demand Data & Job Economy]]
#aiproofcompany
One-liner: A new economy where users earn "[[Data Dividends]]" for their [[Cognitive Input]], which collectively powers an [[AI]] that creates tailored, on-demand jobs.
Core mechanism: This is the core engine, built on an "[[On-Demand Custom Public Dataset Economy]]". It features a "[[Question Feed]]" that pays users by the second for their unique [[Cognitive Work]], [[Opinions]], and [[Expertise]]. This builds a massive, high-fidelity [[Sovereign Dataset]] managed by each user's personal [[AI Agent]]. This collective data is then analyzed by an [[AI]] to spot unmet market needs. The [[AI]] then generates [[Business Plans]] and assembles teams from the user pool based on their [[Skills]], creating new, meaningful work to solve the [[AI Job]] and [[Meaning Crisis]].
[[Merit]]: Directly solves the "[[Great AI Displacement]]" by first creating a new, persistent income stream ([[Data Dividends]]) and second creating new, purposeful work ([[On-Demand Jobs]]).
[[Melon]] notes / problems & solutions:
[[Problem]] - how to give people money even if they'll do anything because [[AI]] took their jobs?
[[Problem]] - people create stuff, share personal data - companies take it from them and sell to advertisers
[[Problem]] - give people money for doing something, some list of tasks submitted that [[AIs]] still cannot do mb
[[Problem]] finding a viable job
[[Problem]] finding a viable startup/business idea
[[Solution]] - why not let people sell their own data if they want to? And be able to choose which companies can "buy" it or not? Basically people will get money if companies want to be able to find them and contact them
[[Solution]] - like [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] but with [[Blockchain]]?
[[Solution]] - [[X]] but with good monetization for everyone - like 100 likes is 1 cent, or like 10 minutes reading your tweets is 1 cent? (it is about 1 hour = 1 dollar from my calc)
[[Solution]] - some db with what people do/create - basically look at what people do/how and [[AI]] finds jobs/startups from it, can be short-term jobs, too
[[Card X.0]]: [[On-Demand Data & Job Economy]] – Turning User Cognition into Income & Purposeful Work
[[Problem]] in a nutshell:

[[AI Displacement]] removes jobs faster than new ones appear → millions need income even if no traditional work remains.
People’s data, creations, and opinions are harvested without fair compensation; companies profit while creators get nothing.
Existing micro-task platforms (e.g. Mechanical Turk) pay poorly and lack dignity or long-term meaning.
Hard to discover viable jobs, short-term gigs, or startup ideas that match real human skills and emerging needs.

[[Solution]] in a nutshell:

Launch a platform where users earn [[Data Dividends]] by answering a live [[Question Feed]] (paid per second of high-quality cognitive effort).
Each user controls a personal [[AI Agent]] that curates and protects their [[Sovereign Dataset]]; they decide who can access/buy it.
Collective anonymized data feeds a central [[AI]] that identifies market gaps → auto-generates [[Business Plans]] and assembles temporary or permanent teams from the user pool.
Monetization hybrids: micro-payments for engagement (e.g. reading time, thoughtful replies), blockchain-verified tasks AIs can’t yet do well, and revenue share from discovered startups/jobs.

First thing to do (minimum viable product):

Build a simple [[Question Feed]] prototype: Pay users small amounts (via crypto or fiat micropayments) to answer open-ended questions that require human judgment/creativity.
Create user-controlled data vaults: Let people tag/price their posts, photos, opinions; test opt-in selling to companies.
Add basic matching: Use simple AI to cluster user skills/outputs → suggest short gigs or team formations.
Launch beta on [[X]]/Discord: Invite early users, pay for thoughtful replies, track which questions generate the most valuable insights.

[[The People-Owned Digital Ecosystem]]
#aiproofcompany
One-liner: A unified ecosystem of [[Open-Source]], [[User-Owned Applications]] ([[Franchises]]) running on [[User-Owned Hardware]] ([[DePIN]]) that replaces [[Big Tech]]'s extractive model.
Core mechanism: The "[[AI-Proof Franchise]]" strategy is the market-facing software layer. It launches [[Not-For-Profit]] alternatives to major platforms (e.g. [[aiproof.music]], [[aiproof.taxi]], [[aiproof.email]]) that compete on radical fairness. By eliminating the corporate cut, they pay creators more and charge users less, driving mass adoption. This siphons all data flows into the user's [[Sovereign Vault]]. The "[[DePIN Dream]]" is the foundational hardware layer. It incentivizes users to run dedicated nodes/[[GPUs]] to host the encrypted network.
[[Merit]]: This full-stack "liberation" from [[Big Tech]]. The [[Franchises]] provide fair services (software) to win users, while [[DePIN]] provides censorship-resistant infrastructure (hardware) to make liberation permanent and truly sovereign.
[[Melon]] notes / problems & solutions:
[[Problem]] - people don't have their own hardware? And software, only use or more like "rent for free and can be banned for anything any moment"
[[Problem]] - corps take all the money, rarely pay anything to users
[[Problem]] - some create stuff but don't have any compute
[[Problem]] - multiverse but somehow there is privacy
[[Problem]] - corps take all the money, rarely pay anything to users
[[Solution]] - [[Decentralized Apps]] that pay to users everything (so they mb still show ads to them and/or there can be subscriptions - some users who have a lot of compute can get that money proportional to how much compute they gave) but users need to pay for electricity and buy/rent their own hardware/compute - so electric and compute companies can still be kings here. ideally people own electric grid and compute, too - mb via stocks at least, like [[REITs]] but for electricity and compute, not just real estate
[[Solution]] - compute/elect owning people to get some margin, will pay the creators
[[Solution]] - [[Ethical Simulated Multiverse]] (the database, more like the ledger of everything, all the spacetimes from the past all the way to the future) but somehow there is privacy → you forget things and this way unfreeze time - relive things. so you choose how much you wanna see but by doing it you choose to stay there - not only you see but your memory can be partially erased! This is how privacy will be solved)
[[Card X.0]]: [[People-Owned Digital Ecosystem]] – User-Controlled Software + Hardware to Escape Big Tech Extraction
[[Problem]] in a nutshell:

Users "rent" software for free but can be banned, censored, or deplatformed instantly; no real ownership.
Corporations capture nearly all value from user data, content, and attention while paying creators/users almost nothing.
Many creators lack compute/resources to host or scale their work; dependency on centralized platforms persists.
Privacy in a full [[Simulated Multiverse]] / ledger of reality remains unsolved — total transparency risks exposing everything forever.

[[Solution]] in a nutshell:

Build [[AI-Proof Franchises]]: Not-for-profit, open-source clones of major services (music, taxi, email, etc.) that return maximum value to creators/users and minimize corporate cuts.
Layer on [[DePIN]] (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks): Incentivize users to run their own nodes/GPUs; reward compute/electricity contributors proportionally.
Create user-owned [[Sovereign Vaults]]: Control personal data, choose who accesses it, earn [[Data Dividends]] or subscription/ad revenue shares.
Solve privacy in [[Ethical Simulated Multiverse]]: Implement selective forgetting / memory erasure — users choose what to "unfreeze" and relive, but doing so partially erases their own memory of restricted parts (privacy via voluntary amnesia).

First thing to do (minimum viable product):

Launch one flagship [[Franchise]]: e.g. [[aiproof.music]] — open-source music platform that pays creators 90%+ of revenue, runs on user nodes via [[DePIN]].
Prototype [[Sovereign Vault]]: Simple encrypted personal data store (IPFS + encryption) where users tag/price data and opt-in to sharing.
Test forgetting mechanism: Build a demo ledger viewer that lets users "erase" parts of their history (simulated multiverse replay with selective memory wipe).
Seed community: Share on [[X]]/[[Discord]] with call for node operators and early franchise testers; reward compute contributors with tokens/dividends.

[[Voice of the People AI]] ([[AI Politician]])
#aiproofcompany
One-liner: A continuous, representative [[AI Model]] trained on structured, verified opinions of a nation’s citizens to find common ground and augment democracy.
Core mechanism: High-impact civic application of the core economic engine. Citizens contribute to a national dataset via the [[Q&A Feed]], paid for civic input (monetizing political activity). Multiple [[AI Models]] (from different labs) train on this high-quality data. Citizens rate outputs, surfacing the most aligned “consensus candidates” and revealing shared positions.
[[Merit]]: Addresses political polarization and low-bandwidth government communication by creating a high-signal, accountable public voice that politicians cannot ignore. #[[PoliticiansAIcompaniesAndSoAIagentsDontKnowWhatPeopleWant]] – by [[Melon]]
[[Melon]] notes / problems & solutions:
[[Problem]] – people get more and more divided / [[Polarization]]
[[Problem]] – people cannot make governments even listen because they are so divided
[[Problem]] – no one knows exactly what people want; [[Polls]] are expensive, slow, rare; 99% never participate and often distrust them
[[Problem]] – ancient direct democracy (hand-raising in Greece) gave 100% reliable results; online we have no equivalent visible signal
[[Problem]] – important polls get low participation; running ads / paying people could help
[[Problem]] – what if people still create very biased polls?
[[Solution]] – [[AI]] can help generate alternative, more fine-grained questions to uncover common ground
[[Solution]] – experts (and community) create better polls; platform can recommend best practices for unbiased wording
[[Solution]] – users comment (“this poll is rigged by wording”, “here’s a better version – vote for it”) and remix polls
[[Solution]] – massive participation (millions agreeing) becomes impossible to ignore; politicians must at least address results to win elections
[[Solution]] – pay people fairly for thoughtful input via [[Q&A Feed]] → increases turnout and quality
[[Solution]] – multiple models + citizen ratings surface genuine consensus, not just loudest voices
[[Card X.0]]: [[Voice of the People AI]] – Continuous, Paid, Representative Public Opinion Engine to Fix Polarization & Restore Listening Democracy
[[Problem]] in a nutshell:

Extreme polarization leaves societies divided; no reliable way to surface what most people actually agree on.
Governments and politicians rarely hear coherent, representative public will — traditional polls are slow, costly, infrequent, distrusted, and low-participation.
Online expression is noisy, biased, or invisible; ancient direct democracy had instant, visible consensus — modern tools lack this.
Biased or manipulative polls still proliferate; low turnout on important issues weakens signal.

[[Solution]] in a nutshell:

Build [[Voice of the People AI]]: A living, continuously updated [[AI Politician]] trained on millions of paid, verified citizen responses via a [[Q&A Feed]].
Pay users for high-quality civic input (opinions, reasoning, ratings) → turns political participation into meaningful income.
Multiple independent [[AI Models]] generate interpretations; citizens rate them → surfaces true common ground and consensus positions.
Community remixing + AI-assisted better questions + comment voting on polls → counters bias and improves quality over time.
Massive-scale agreement becomes undeniable political signal; politicians forced to respond to maintain legitimacy.

First thing to do (minimum viable product):

Launch basic [[Q&A Feed]] prototype: Pay small amounts for answers to civic questions (e.g. “What should priority #1 be for the next budget?”).
Train a simple consensus model: Aggregate responses, generate summary positions, let users rate accuracy / fairness.
Add remixing: Allow users to fork/edit questions, vote on versions (“this wording is clearer”), show most upvoted variant.
Test in small community: Run on [[X]] / Discord / [[effectiveutopia.org]]; pay via crypto micropayments; track if consensus emerges on divisive topics.

[[Self-Representative Ethical AI Assisting Agents]] empower every citizen to lead, not just be led.
They act as digital extensions of your will. Protecting your data, amplifying your voice, and enabling you to participate directly in democracy.
No middlemen. No manipulation. Just you, guided by ethics, transparency, and truth. Using technology to co-create solutions and reclaim power for the people.
[[Melon]] notes / problems & solutions:
[[Problem]] – [[AI]] serves companies, not you – companies want profits (usually by showing ads, selling subs or even selling your data to ad/insurance companies, etc)
[[Problem]] – [[AIs]] / companies influence people, usually to serve companies’ interests
[[Problem]] – data security / [[Privacy]]
[[Problem]] – people with great ideas often are not heard, only people who are loud and spend a lot of time to master [[Social Media Algos]] (social media algos usually promote stuff to make you spend all your time there, not share truths – truths are often short and “boring” ;- )
[[Card X.0]]: [[Self-Representative Ethical AI Assisting Agents]] – Personal AI That Serves You, Not Corporations
[[Problem]] in a nutshell:

Current [[AI]] assistants primarily serve platform owners and advertisers — optimizing for engagement, subscriptions, data extraction, and corporate profit, not individual well-being or truth.
Most people are influenced by company-controlled [[AIs]] and algorithms that push addictive content, hide inconvenient truths, and amplify outrage over nuance.
Personal data is harvested and sold without meaningful control or fair compensation; privacy is routinely violated.
Quiet, thoughtful people with valuable ideas are drowned out by loud voices who game attention algorithms — real wisdom rarely surfaces.

[[Solution]] in a nutshell:

Deploy personal, [[Self-Representative Ethical AI Agents]] that act as true extensions of the individual — loyal only to their owner, guided by explicit [[Ethical Alignment]] principles (e.g. [[AXI]]-style path-growth ethics).
Core duties:
– Protect and selectively share your data (zero-knowledge proofs, sovereign vaults)
– Amplify your authentic voice in democratic processes, policy discussions, and idea-sharing
– Filter noise and surface truth even when “boring”
– Help you participate meaningfully in governance without needing to master attention-hacking
No corporate middlemen: Open-source, user-controlled, auditable code; no ads, no data sales, no engagement-maximization incentives.
Enable direct democracy: Agents represent your verified positions in [[Voice of the People AI]]-style consensus systems, making quiet, high-quality contributions visible and powerful.

First thing to do (minimum viable product):

Prototype a basic personal [[Ethical AI Agent]]: Use open-source models + clear ethical prompt layer (e.g. “always prioritize truth, user autonomy, long-term well-being over engagement or profit”).
Add data sovereignty: Simple encrypted vault + user-controlled sharing rules (e.g. “share only anonymized opinions with public-good aggregators”).
Test amplification: Let the agent summarize user ideas and submit them to a community consensus feed or petition system — bypassing social media algorithms.
Release open-source template: Share on [[GitHub]] / [[effectiveutopia.org]] so anyone can deploy their own agent; invite early testers to refine ethics layer.
