# Code of Conduct

We expect everyone to follow a standard code of conduct: be respectful, inclusive, and considerate.

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please open an issue or contact the maintainers.

(You may replace this with your preferred CoC text; this is a minimal placeholder.)
